# Identity Enabled Distribution Control System

The goal of this project is to develop an end-to-end (E2E) Digital Rights Management (DRM) system, named Identity Enabled Distribution Control System (IEDCS), for sharing protected files such as media or documents.

In this specific case we will consider that the player can communicate with the DRM servers. As it is typical in a DRM system, media objects are not publicly available and must be acquired (e.g., at a Music Store), users are then allowed to play the media files with some restrictions: only in X (2) devices, a limited number of times, at a given time of the day, or in a determined region. Any other policy can be designed and implemented according to licensing and distribution restrictions. Students are free to choose what content to distribute and what the IEDCS will protect. eBooks in plain text format is perfectly acceptable. An eBook player will essentially scroll through plain text files.
