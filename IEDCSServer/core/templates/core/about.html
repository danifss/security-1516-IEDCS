<h1>About Us</h1>

<p>
    <span>
        The goal of this project is to develop an end-to-end (E2E) Digital Rights
        Management (DRM) system, named Identity Enabled Distribution Control
        System (IEDCS), for sharing protected files such as media or documents.
        In this specific case we will consider that the player can communicate with
        the DRM servers.
